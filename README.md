# sketchy-leetcode
In this repository I will be updating my leetcode solutions as well as a visualization of the solution that can immediately give an idea on how the solution was crafted.
I had trouble understanding and writing solutions for Linkedlists, Trees, backtracking etc data structures. However, with practice and visualizing the problems I am now able to solve them and even optimize the solution.
This repository ha sthe following structure
